# Assignment1
There are three exercises:
* Write a firmware program running on TIVA-123 that allow user press two Switches (SW1, SW2). When pressing SW1, the RED led will be light. When pressing SW2, the Green led will be light. When two SWs are pressed, the Blue led will be light. If no led is pressed, turn off all leds.

* Write a firmware program running on TIVA-123 that allow user use Terminal from PC to communicate with the Kit. When the Kit receives command "RON", turn on RED led. When it get command "ROFF", turn off RED led. Similarly, two remainning leds are also dealed as the Red led. Polling structure is required in this exercise.

* Write a firmware program with the function same as the exercise2, but interrupt structure is required here.

* (Option) Write an Application to communicate with TIVA-C through UART.
